### Note:
**In order to run the script you will have to modify line number 21 to your own             working directory**

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
